# hackathon-cusehacks
projectOne(April 2018)

projectOne was created by me and two team members (Justin Russo and Trevor Petrus) for CuseHacks. CuseHacks is a 24hr hackathon located in Syracuse University.

Running on Node.js

Brief Overview:
  System allows users to have instant translation between messages.
	Allows users to send/receive messages between each other.
  Each user can type in any language to which the individual feels most comfortable.
	Each user can select any language from the dropdown menu to which they want their incoming messages to display.
    note: more languages can be added easily with, the already in use, Google Translating API.
